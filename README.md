## Description

The Bee Service interacts with optional user facing technology and [Quest Dolphin JS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-dolphin-js).
It stores and synchronizes configuration data, discovers relevant dolphin peers, spawns, protects and repairs multiple pods of dolphin instances and provides core protocol nodes to multiple pods of dolphin instances when used in a single application.
